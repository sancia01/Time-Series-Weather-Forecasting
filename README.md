# Time-Series-Weather-Forecasting

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting rainfall and temperature variations for multiple cities. It aims to understand seasonal and trend components of the data and develop accurate forecasting models.

# Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze temperature and precipitation distributions and identify deviations from historical averages.
Model Building: Develop and compare different forecasting models.
Evaluation: Assess model performance and visualize results.

# Methods and Models

# Data Cleaning:
Forward fill and interpolation to handle missing values.
Outlier detection and removal.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
Seasonal decomposition to analyze trends and seasonality.
Box plots and deviation analysis for visualization.

# Modeling:
SARIMA: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for forecasting rainfall.
LSTM Neural Network: Long Short-Term Memory model for precipitation forecasting.
Exponential Smoothing: Holt-Winters model for time series forecasting.
